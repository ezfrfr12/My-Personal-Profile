<h1 class="Link">Dreams and Goals</h1>

<p class="Link"> 
    I have many dreams and goals so does many people wheater its
    being an engineer, a doctor, or anything similar people have dreams 
    whats so ever but the main thing I am going to talk about is my dreams
    of becoming a buisness man and why?
    <br><br>
    Ive always wanted to be rich just like business men though they looked like
    homeless bald people and looked stressed because it seems like they are like always busy, streesed, 
    and basically just looked blue. Though it doesnt stop me from wanting to be rich
    because money. I always admired there passion, creativity, and their vision for the future. I 
    wanted to be similar like them so I could possibly might change the future ahead of me.
    <br><br>
    In order for me to succed this mission Ive had goals such as pursue in a high quality prestigous school
    in buisness. I belive a high quality knoledge can help one achieve their goal and mission thats because 
    with very good ideas and creativity we can be able to succeed the missions and goal. As a conclusion of this 
    buisness men are hard working people that work for their family, friends, and the ones you love. Being rich means being
    able to provide for you family.

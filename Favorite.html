        My Favorite food are fried chicken and steak its so delcious, it has such good flavor it amazes its one of the most popular if not the most popular dishes in the world. Fried Chicken coated in flour, eggs, spices. It simply is just an amazing food to be made. Steak its a high class meal that if were to be cook by a professional it would cost alot it packs a large amount of juicy flavor which is very delightful for your taste buds.

        My Favorite films or pieces of fiction. There are argubly many shows that are either good or bad but what I used to thing was bad was One Piece and now its one of my favorites if not my favorite. Their is just something about it that makes it my comfort show its funny its intresting and just holds so much emotional moments. Not only the manga but the Live action was good too. It has an amazing story, amazing world building, intresting and fantastic characters and lastly its just beautiful.
